          <h1>An Introduction to Mosaik</h1><br><br>
            <h2>Let’s start with why:</h2>
            <p>Mosaik is staffed by a team of tech and startup enthusiasts, personal developers, and community organizers.
            Each one of us is powered everyday by encouraging others to unlock their creative and entrepreneurial
            potential. As community builders, we recognize that the most efficient way to maximize our potential is to
            work together, in one collaborative living room.<br>

            From there on out, our task was simple -- we set about partnering with the community and engineering a
            community platform where local entrepreneurs can flourish in our beloved city of Budapest.</p><br>
            <a name="manifesto"></a><h2>The Mosaik Manifesto:</h2><br>
            <h1>WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF ENTREPRENEURS</h1>
            <p>The unreasonable ones. The ones who solve our problems, create our jobs, and push the world forward.</p><br>
            <h1>WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF BUDAPEST</h1><br>
            <p>Budapest is on the rise. Fast. With a budding startup ecosystem, vibrant downtown scene and
              affordable lifestyle. It's like a magnet for young talent. Couple that with a convenient location
              in the heart of Europe and you have the perfect place to launch and explore your dream project.</p><br>
            <h1>WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF COMMUNITY</h1><br>
            <p>At Mosaik we’re building a tribe of engineers, designers, creatives, and tech innovators. We’re
              building this tribe to lead a movement. We’re leading a movement to change a city. And we’re changing
              a city to improve the tech startup world, especially in Central Eastern Europe.</p><br>

            <h1>And we want to have a great time along the way!</h1>
            <a name="values"></a><h2>Values and Guiding Principles:</h2><br>
            <p>Our members and visitors work and grow across a wide range of industries and products -- you’ll
              find FinTech startups working next to the latest and greatest mobile app, and bumping elbows with world
              class IT engineers making the next disruptive technology. So what binds us all together? Quite simply,
              it’s the way we approach life. In times of both triumph or failure, we count on our community members to
              respond with a mindset of positivity and growth.<br>
              <span class="highlight">Check it out.</span><br>
              <h3>LIFELONG LEARNING</h3>
              <p>A fascination with the world. Realising that everything can be a learning opportunity,
                if you choose it to be.</p><br>
              <h3>COLLABORATION</h3>
              <p>1 + 1 = 10. Working together to fill gaps and improve the community rather than duplicating efforts.</p><br>
              <h3>OPENNESS</h3>
              <p>Being an active listener. Always being prepared to share, adopt or challenge new ideas, thoughts, tools,
                or people.</p><br>
              <h3>INTENTION</h3>
              <p>Crafting the life you want. Never settling. Why spend your life working on something you don't love?</p><br>
              <h3>COMMUNITY</h3>
              <p>The incredible things that can happen when people with energy, ambition and shared values come
                together to create a future they believe in.</p><br>
              <h3>POSITIVITY</h3>
              <p>Recognizing that some failure is inevitable when trying something new, and when it comes, embracing
                 it gracefully, to find the learnings in every experience and relationship.</p><br>
              <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
              <p>Finding purposeful, constructive ways to use technology to shape our rapidly changing, increasingly
                 interconnected world.</p><br>
              <a href="questions"></a><h2>Questions?</h2><br>
              <p>You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers!<br>
                The best way to learn more about Mosaik is to ask one of our staff members, or better yet, get the
                full low down from one of our awesome members! If you’ve got specific questions about membership,
                upcoming events visit our reception area or catch one of our lovely team members at any point!</p>

              <a href="respecting_mosaik"></a><h2>Respecting Mosaik<br>
                Aka How to be a Responsible Community Member</h2><br><br>
                <p>Being a member of Mosaik comes with the benefits of connecting, sharing ideas, information, support,
                   and of course coworking in a motivational environment. In exchange, we expect our members to keep some
                   things at the forefront of their minds in taking care of each other and our space:<br><br>
                   → Your equipment & professional liability is your responsibility.<br>
                   → Leave any space you use as you found it or better than you found it. <br>
                   → Anyone who behaves in an manner that is destructive to the space or other participants may be asked
                    to leave. This includes excessive noise or loud conversations in quiet workspaces, smelly food in the
                     kitchen or fridge, and desks so cluttered that they affect your neighbors.<br>
                   → Be responsible and respectful using our internet. Bittorrent and porn are absolutely not allowed.
                   Large (1GB+) downloads or uploads during business hours aren't strictly prohibited...but it's rude to hog
                   bandwidth.<br>
                   → Respect others’ personal and business privacy, confidentiality, safety, property and data. If you're not
                    sure, ask them.<br>
                   → Please no smoking in the courtyard. The smoking area is located at the front entrance of Mosaik, where
                   we kindly ask you to dispose of your cigarette in the ashtray.<br>
                   → Respect the neighbors and the rest of the community when you’re in the front of the building. No large
                   groups should congregate to drink/smoke outside. Noise levels outside should be kept to a minimum! Please
                   do not leave any trash in front of the building. <br><br>

                <a href="respecting_each_other"></a><h2>Respecting Each Other<br>
                  Aka How To Be A Most Excellent Community Member</h2><br><br>
                  Being a great member of the Mosaik community happens a bit differently than in some other settings. It's more organic,
                   and less mechanical. We’re a coworking space, not just another networking event. This also means that often, it takes
                    time.<br>
                  <span class="highlight">Trust</span> is a big deal for us at Mosaik, and it plays a big role in being a great community
                   member.<br>
                   <span class="blue">Here's an observation for consideration:</span><br>
                   → In order to help, someone needs to be ready to accept that help.<br>
                   → In order for people to be ready to accept help, they need to be able to be willing to be vulnerable enough to ask
                   for help.<br>
                   → Being vulnerable requires establishing trust in the source. People are drawn to trusted sources, not authoritative
                   sources.<br>
                   → The difference between establishing authority and trust, in our experience, is being able to show some vulnerability
                   yourself.<br><br>
                   <span class="fine_print">This bit of text was also borrowed and modified from our friends at <a href="wwww.indyhall.org">

                    With this in mind, sometimes the best way to give help is to first establish trust, by receiving help rather than offering it.
                     There are lots of ways to do that, of course, but the most effective ways tend to be small and personal rather than a blast
                     to the entire community. Take it one relationship at a time!<br>
